## According to Peirce's semiotics, the dynamic interpretant refers to the actual understanding or interpretation reached by a mind at any particular point in the process of interpreting a sign. It is the effect actually produced on the mind by the sign, or the actual interpretation made of the sign.

In other words, the dynamic interpretant is the immediate result of the interaction between the sign and the interpreter's mind. It is the understanding that we reach, or which the sign determines, at any particular semiotic stage.

The dynamic interpretant has several key features:

1. **Actual effect**: The dynamic interpretant is an actual effect on the mind, rather than a potential or hypothetical one.
2. **Particular point in time**: It occurs at a specific point in the process of interpretation, and represents the understanding reached up to that point.
3. **Incomplete understanding**: The dynamic interpretant represents an incomplete understanding of the sign, as it is influenced by previous interpretations and the immediate context.
4. **Funded result**: As Ransdell (1977) puts it, the dynamic interpretant is the "funded result" of all interpretation prior to the interpretation of the given sign.

To illustrate this concept, consider an example from the text: when someone says "I saw her duck under the table", the dynamic interpretant would be your understanding that you are the utterer, I am the addressee, and that they saw our cowardly acquaintance hide beneath a table. This is the actual interpretation reached by your mind in response to the sign.

In summary, the dynamic interpretant refers to the actual interpretation or understanding reached by a mind at any particular point in the process of interpreting a sign, representing an incomplete understanding influenced by previous interpretations and context.

Chunk 1 
The second type of interpretant that any sign must have is the dynamic interpretant. This is our understanding of the sign/dynamic object relationship at some actual instance in the chain of signs. Peirce describes the dynamic interpretant as the “effect actually produced on the mind” (CP8 .343 1908), or as the “actual effect which the sign, as a sign, really determines” (CP4 .536 1906). The dynamic interpretant, then, is the understanding we reach, or which the sign determines, at any particular semiotic stage.

To continue with linguistic examples, we know that the dynamic interpretant is the actual interpretation we make, or understanding we reach, in the first instance of interpretation. For instance, when you say to me whilst pointing at some cowardly woman we know, “I saw her duck under the table”, the dynamic interpretant is my understanding that you are the utterer, that I am the addressee, and that you saw our cowardly acquaintance hide beneath a table.

Chunk 2 
There is also an interesting connection between the dynamic interpretant and the immediate object. As the understanding we actually reach at any particular point in the sign chain, the dynamic interpretant represents an incomplete understanding, or interpretation, of the dynamic object. More important, though, is that the immediate object of some sign in a sign chain consists of the actual interpretations made previously, that is, it consists of the dynamic interpretants from earlier stages in the sign chain. As Ransdell (1977, 169) puts it, the “immediate object is, in other words, the funded result of all interpretation prior to the interpretation of the given sign”. The dynamic interpretant then, is the actual interpretation or understanding we make at some point in the semiotic process, and also constitutes, along with previous dynamic interpretants, the immediate object, or partial understanding we have of the dynamic object at any particular point in the semiotic process.

Chunk 3 
The [Dynamic] Interpretant is whatever interpretation any mind actually makes of a sign. […]The Final Interpretant does not consist in the way in which any mind does act but in the way in which every mind would act. That is, it consists in a truth which might be expressed in a conditional proposition of this type: “If so and so were to happen to any mind this sign would determine that mind to such and such conduct.” […] The Immediate Interpretant consists in the Quality of the Impression that a sign is fit to produce, not to any actual reaction. […] [I]f there be any fourth kind of Interpretant on the same footing as those three, there must be a dreadful rupture of my mental retina, for I can’t see it at all. (CP8 .315 1909).

Chunk 4 

Just as the dynamic interpretant has clear connections with other elements of Peirce’s semiotic, so too does the final interpretant. As should be clear, from the connections that emerge from the notion of inquiry, the final interpretant interacts strongly with the dynamic object. The final interpretant, then, is important to our understanding of the dynamic object in a couple of ways. First, it is the point where our grasp of the dynamic object would be complete and, according to Ransdell (1977, 169–170), is where the immediate object and the dynamic object coincide. This represents the full assimilation or integration of the dynamic object into our system of signs. Second, the final interpretant functions as an exemplar or normative standard by which we can judge our actual interpretative responses to the sign. As David Savan puts it, “Peirce’s intention was to identify the third type of interpretant as providing a norm or standard by which particular stages (Dynamical Interpretants) of an historical process may be judged.” (Savan 1988, 62).

Chunk 5 
explicit content of the sign which would enable a person to say whether or not the sign was applicable to anything concerning which that person had sufficient acquaintance. It is the total unanalyzed impression which the sign might be expected to produce, prior to any critical reflection upon it. (Savan 1988, 53). 

In terms of an example where ordinary sentences are the signs, the immediate interpretant will involve something like our recognition of grammatical categories, syntactic structures and conventional rules of use. For instance, without knowing anything about its context of utterance, we can surmise certain things about the sentence, “we don’t want to hurt him, do we?”. We know it is a question, we know it concerns doing harm to some person, a male, and so on. These things are part of the immediate interpretant of the sign.
